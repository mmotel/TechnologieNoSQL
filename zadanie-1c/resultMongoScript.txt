The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>  <p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p> ",
